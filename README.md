# Scrappy
A python scraper that returns the number of citations for a research paper.

To run:
1) Install python 2.7
2) Download the project
3) Keep the article in the same folder as that of scraper.py
4) Run the program, specify the file name and use the result for your needs :)

There's just one problem with this. It works for those research papers which have
the references numbered in the format of [n] where n is the number of the reference.
Very soon, I'll be developing another application for this which should work for all
the possible formats of papers.
